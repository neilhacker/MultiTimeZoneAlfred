# MultiTimeZoneAlfred
This is based off the workflow by Dean Jackson from this thread: https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/16680-paste-different-timezones-hotkey-using-selected-time-text/

Changes inspired by a tweet from Devon: https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1433507909808316425

To use, write time, highlight the text and press hotkey. The functionality is:

10am -> 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm GMT

10:45am -> 10:45am PT / 1:45pm ET / 6:45pm GMT

If you go into the alfred workflow you can change the actual timezones you want and the ordering.
